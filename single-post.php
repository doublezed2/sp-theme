            <p>The restaurant industry is hectic and laden with cut throat competition, which is why standing out in the crowd is so important to the success and longevity of any restaurateur’s business.
              One marketing channel that may have flown under your nose is a simple one that lies within your very own walls—your employees.
              Turning employees into brand advocates for your restaurant and having them share positive, authentic messages can help you gain more exposure and customers. By prioritizing employee advocacy, you can form the narrative for your restaurant that shows it in the best possible light and grow your reputation in the industry.
              That extended reach and engagement when employees advocate for your brand can ultimately benefit sales. SocialChorus, an employee<strong> communications software company, found that a 12% increase in brand advocacy</strong> can double revenue growth.
              Plus, brand advocacy doesn’t cost anything, making it a low investment, high reward option for marketing.
